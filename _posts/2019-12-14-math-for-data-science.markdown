The relegation of mathematics to something of an optional extra in the Data Science space while understandable, is unfortunate. is driven also by matters of practicality. Data Science, still being a field in its infancy, is such a broad discipline. It touches on software engineering, computer science, numerous brances of mathematics. Working in the field might involve reproting, using vendor specific tooling It uses nomenclature across these different disciplines. It draws on frameworks and libraries that each create their own language domains, and leaves aspiring creates the practical problem of deciding what is best to learn next.

Workign in such such a rapidly paced context, the aquistion of mathematical skills is difficult. Mathematical through takes time to cultivate Because there are also many tasks that seem to have very little do with mathematics. As a case in point, over the last year I have been mostly invovled in developing data engineering pipelines, devoping metadata applications, and devops. Taking a team through clean readable and testable code None of this has been particularly mathematical problems but in fact, mostly the opposite, Interestingly, building data focused software understanding the cultural nature of the domain, how data movest through an organisation adn how to get value out of it, undeerstanding. Writing software. 

But I would argue there is subtelty at play here. argument is that to do things efficiently. Rushing through a quick mathematics primer. There is commitment required, and it does take time.  Acqurigin mathematical maturity will help you with Data Engineering, the way you design, but the benefits, of this, to see through complexity for what it is, mathematics is clarity of throught simply will not need it, mathematical maturity, move away from complexity


### What to learn

If you decide that you would like to acquire an understanding of mathematics, the first problem is then where to begin.   I saw an interesting post and a fantastic reading list around <a href="#">becoming quant</a> and Most of us have not had the luxury of  the point that you should learn math does this leave math? But it also raises the issue of how much, and which math If you are making and evaluating deep learning models, need to have mathematical maturity to do data science. TIme is strange,

THe things I would suggests is that you should do <b>Precalculus</b>, <b>Linear Algebra</b>, <b>Single and Multi-variate Calculus</b>, <b>Statistics</b>, and <b>Probability</b>. As well as this I would encourage you to develop an understaninding of the context and history of these subjects to understand them.   

### Precalculus

One of the biggest difficulties in learning mathematics is that is so unforgiving when one tries to jump ahead. Seeking to understand more advanced topics such as Calculus and Linear Algebra without a firm grasp of the basics, because math. It may seem like a backwards step to go back to some o fthe topics of precalculus, such as Trigonometry, and Conics, but more complicated applications of advanced topics often involve these things, the more advanced topics found in secondary or high schools. There are many reasons not be concermed about this - most people do not learn the basics well, I am constantly struck by the difficulty of applying advanced mathematics due to a poor treatment of the foundational things. 

Further, the topics of Precalculus should not be thought of as rudimentary. These were the concerns of Euclid, Archimedes, Descartes history of mathematics reveals sophisticaion

There are of course many resources to understand this from  is important. However the best I have found is <a href="#">Precalculus</a> textbook by Stitz and Zeager. I particularly like this textbook because it is not a rushed final-exam-focused high school treatment, designed to rote learn. It has been so thoughtfully put together both in its design, also work through it. It also presents a nice transiation from working through exercises (of wich there are man in this text) and mathematical thinking, with a nod to important developments in mathematics. It will cover of critical things (such as Trigonometry, Logarithms, Conics, etc.) in a deep and thoughtful way which will allow a excellent starting point.

When you work through this textbook, follow what may be some counter intuitive advice: don't rush and don't use a calculator. Just work through each set of excercises, understand everything. Learning about the discipline of mathematical thinking. The more advanced you become, you will gain speed, but that is predicated on not rushing things at this stage. 

### Calculus

Calculus is a logical next step after Precalculus. At its heart is the idea of charting not only functinos, but the behaviour of functions over certain domains. Rates of change or derivatives, extremely powerful, functions to model phenomena.  When you come to Caclulus the utility of understanding mathematics will become more apparent - not only in using, I would start with Calculus is more contained, and Banner's great book. 

There is a great Coursera course on Ohio State University, by James Fowler, a wonderful lecturer. This textbook is highly

Vapnick notes, that it does not matter which data you put into these. 


### Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is an extension if ideas of the cartesian number plane and behaviours of numbers as they work on this place. One of the most powerful ideas is not that, if looking side on, if numbers are pushed into higher or lower dimensions, they will yeild patterns, this profound idea, depending on how we observe nubmers, is extremely powerful, One of the challenges was how to work through this work. 

There is a student challenge. Working on paper. I think Linear Algebra is an ideal opportunity to mathematical programming in R or Python. Some subjects (particular Linear Algebra, certain topics in statistics)

### The context and history of mathematics 

In the end  powerful support for code snippets:


### In the age of the internet, help is always out there. 

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Great
